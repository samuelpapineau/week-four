# Introduction 
The first module was one in which I found a lot of difficulty keeping up with the work, some delays coming from bad weather when heading out to the cemetery in Week 2, other delays happening with other things unrelated to the course. Regardless, this module was very interesting and taught me a lot about what digital archarology truly is.

## Win

With what I've learned so far, I would have to consider many wins throughout parts of this module. For one, the place I had chosen for my data collection was incredibly beautiful, and gave me some insight on why a person might want to be buried there. Plus, the fact that the location I had chosen had so much information already prepared in advance by Gatineau Park was simply fantastic. In the later parts of the module, I did find that having prior experience with some of the technologies really helped me piece together the work that I had to do, and in a way I suppose it gives me a different perspective on the assignment compared to someone else who might not have the same experience as me.

## Fail

I encountered many fails throughout this module, with the biggest one being that when I left the Graveyard, I felt that the information I had filled out in the forms was either inaccurate or incomplete due to the restrictive nature of both the location and the forms themselves. When working on the later parts of the module as well, I found that the information I had, including the pictures and the location data, were not as accurate or as clear as I had hoped. So while I did complete the work, it was not completed in the way I wanted.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I face is probably the time I require to learn new technologies and to use them in the way I am supposed to for this class. It is hard for me to tell how much time something will take for me to learn and is therefore hard for me to plan things out. It really is a unique situation since some things I already know, and some things I don't. I plan on fully catching up in the coming weeks, especially with reading week around the corner. Another challenge I've had was connecting the reading material to the course content. While the subjects of both are the same, the content itself is different and can be tricky to link together. 

## Implications?

I think that at the end of this module, I've taken in a new understanding of what digital archaeology truly is. Collecting data and refining it into something else such as a map or 3d image isn't easy and requires familiarity with many different technologies, and the world of digital archaeology really is much more than many people think. It is comforting to know that one day we will have the technology to do things like photogrammetry much more easily than we currently can today, and hopefully we will be able to see that future very soon.

## Previous Feedback
Some previous feedback was that I should focus more on my observations from the readings/podcasts and to tie them to the work I am doing in the course. I tried to adapt my approach by relating the content of the articles to my own work as a comparison. I also followed the podcasts and instructions carefully to make sure I was getting as close to the final result as I could (with some issues making this more difficult, as mentioned in the Fail section).

## Changes I'm making moving forward

I think one of the key things I will be doing moving forward is trying to tie the readings/podcasts to the course content rather than tie the course conteent to the readings/podcasts . What I mean is I want to put a greater emphasis on the readings and podcasts themselves and try to focus more on how they affect my work, along with the content of the course. Before this I was focusing more on the content and I was trying to see how the readings related to what I was doing. This should make things easier in my weekly journals in the future.
